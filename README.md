# 💥 About

Know a banger when you see one?

With BANGER!, you can bet on a cast to go viral on Warpcast using Chiliz Fan Tokens.

Install the [cast action](https://warpcast.com/bangerbets), and click BANGER! to bet on your favorite athlete or sports team’s recent cast. Fan Tokens give you exclusive token-gated access to bet on the virality of their casts—so the better you know your team, the more you win!

When users see a new cast they know will go viral, they click the cast action to bet. This redirects them to a betting page, where they input the number of likes they predict the cast will have in 24 hours + a bet amount in ETH.

Once a bet is published, an automated cast by [@BangerBets](https://warpcast.com/bangerbets) is posted to allow other users to challenge the bet. The challenger puts down the same amount of ETH, but is betting that the cast will have less likes than what the original bettor predicts. If no one matches the bet, the original bettor will receive their entire bet back.

If a challenger matches the bet, we wait 24 hours and see how many likes the cast has. The winner of the bet will win double the ETH they put down, which they can claim in the My Bets page!

Sports betting is limited to being a seasonal + in-game experience. By betting on casts, we can leverage the social followings of athletes + teams, ultimately creating a year-round, off the field experience.

To assess fan loyalty, we leverage Chiliz Fan Tokens, which provides true fans the exclusive opportunity to bet and be rewarded.

Our [@BangerBets](https://warpcast.com/bangerbets) bot also autopost bets, which creates a viral loop and taps into the large audience on Farcaster.
